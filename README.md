Title:
Examining the Potential for Adversarial Reprogramming Cyber Attacks on Nuclear Machine Learning Systems Utilizing Iterative FGSM

This repository is to hold the academic article I published and presented at the 2023 International Conference on Mathematics and Computational Methods Applied to Nuclear Science and Engineering (ANS M&C 2023). While the article was published and presented there, it apparently wasn't published to any proper publications. Therefore, I am hosting it here to display the work I've done. 

While the paper itself wasn't published, at the very least you can see the paper and details in the program on their website. The presentation was in the following section in the program: "Mo3T3 Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence - 1 ".
