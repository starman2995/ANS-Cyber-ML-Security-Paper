Title:
Examining the Potential for Adversarial Reprogramming Cyber Attacks on Nuclear Machine Learning Systems Utilizing Iterative FGSM

This repository is to hold the academic article I published and presented at the 2023 International Conference on Mathematics and Computational Methods Applied to Nuclear Science and Engineering (ANS M&C 2023). While the article was published and presented there, it apparently wasn't published to any proper publications. Therefore, I am hosting it here to display the work I've done.
